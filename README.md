This repository contains all scripts and template used to manage [geo-front3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-front3) and [geo-api3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-api3).

It relies on a collection of Bash and Python3 scripts. Tasks are launched with [manuel](https://github.com/ShaneKilkelly/manuel) a task runner for Bash.

[geo-front3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-front3) and [geo-api3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-api3) are based on [mf-geoadmin3](https://github.com/geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3) and [mf-chsdi3](https://github.com/geoadmin/mf-chsdi3).
Thoses two softwares were created by [swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/) the Federal Office of Topography of Switzerland for their geoportal [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch).
They are released under the BSD licence.

[geo-front3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-front3) and [geo-api3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-api3) were forked and adapted to modernize the geoportals proposed by [sigeom sa](https://www.sigeom.ch/) a Swiss civil engineer, GIS specialist and land surveying company.
The adaptation was performed by [Ioda-Net Sàrl](https://ioda-net.ch/) a Swiss company specialized in Open Source software.

The following companies give financial support, help to keep this software up to date with swisstopo code, and open source:
- [sigeom sa](https://www.sigeom.ch) 2740 Moutier, Switzerland
- [Ioda-Net Sàrl](https://ioda-net.ch/) CH-2947 Charmoille, Switzerland
